# Elastos Upgrade Document

The Node upgrades include automatic shell upgrades and manual upgrades, The auto-upgrade node is based on node.sh.

But in the complex upgrade process including updating configuration files, updating data files, etc. will be combined with node.sh to provide a new automated upgrade script file, so this document is very important, please use this document as the main reference.

Support nodes including ELA, ESC, EID, Arbiter.
